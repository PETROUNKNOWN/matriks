Matriks 2.0.0 is an interactive grid and reticle customization application built using the ```customtkinter``` library.

  - Adjust intersection marker size for better visibility.

### Reticle Customization

- Reticle Color: Select from predefined colors such as red, green, blue, and white.
- Line Thickness: Adjust reticle line thickness from 1 to 8 for better clarity.
- Gap Size: Modify the gap between reticle lines for enhanced precision.

### Canvas Configuration
- Canvas Size: Select canvas dimensions, supporting sizes of ``400x400``, ``500x500``, or ``800x800`` pixels.
- Accent Color: Personalize the appâ€™s UI with your preferred accent color.

### Dynamic Interaction
- The application dynamically updates the canvas to reflect user-selected configurations in real-time, providing an intuitive and seamless user experience.

## Queries
1. Reticle is not visible:
   ![reticleIssue](resources/screenshots/appGridTypeError.png)
   - Check the `Grid Type`, ensure that it is not in `Solid`.
   - To circumvent this, simply increase the `Reticle Line Size` to a value bigger that 1.
   - This happens since the canvas overlays the grid lines above the reticle and since they have similar thickness, the reticle seems to disappear
